## Business Problem
A game company wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) by using some features of its customers, and to create segments according to these new customer definitions and to estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.

For Example:
How much money come from it's customer who is 25-year-old, male and from Turkey, and he is an IOS user. 

## Dataset 
Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products.The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction.This means that the table is not deduplicated.In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.
